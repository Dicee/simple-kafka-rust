/// This client handles the batching of individual records. It selects the partition to send the record to based on the record's key, if present, or in a
/// round-robin fashion otherwise. Batches can be flushed by two separate mechanisms: when the max size is reached, immediately after the last record was
/// added, or when the duration elapsed between the first insertion in the batch to the current time exceeds the configured linger duration. The expiry
/// mechanism works on a separate thread, while the batching process happens on a single thread (the thread the [Client::send_record] method is called from).
/// Regardless of why a batch is flushed out, it is submitted asynchronously on another thread (a single one), in order to keep the main producer thread
/// quick and have low contention on the mutex. The client is expected to be used from a single thread. Note that to get more throughput on the same producer
/// host, it is possible to have several clients running in different threads, or otherwise make small changes to this struct to make it fully thread-safe
/// (having several clients would reduce the batching potential, so it's not very desirable).
///
/// As explained in [BatchPublisher], we have made significant simplifications to the problem by not handling some failure scenarios. Please read this doc
/// for more information. We could definitely handle those, it's just more work and this is a personal project for fun and learning, so I have to put some
/// limits to keep things manageable.
